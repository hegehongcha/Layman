# LaymanRRG
Offical repo for [_X-ray Made Simple: Radiology Report Generation and Evaluation with Layman's Terms_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17911), where we propose [LaymanRRG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17911).



# Dataset
We have released our 50k report-level dataset at [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LaymanRRG/LaymanRRG-report-level) with professional radiology reports translated into layman's terms and corresponding image IDs from mimic. This dataset can faciliate the training of the RRG models with enhanced semantics described in the paper.

# Code
Our code implementation is coming soon.
